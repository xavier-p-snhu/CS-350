# CS-350

The two projects included in this repository showcase my progress in working with embedded systems. The first project, "gpiointerrupt," is a program designed to flash "SOS" or "OK" signals using the system's LEDs. The second project, "project2," is a thermometer that communicates over UART to provide temperature readings and activates an LED if the temperature falls below a programmable threshold.

I am particularly proud of my ability to analyze problems and desired outcomes and translate that understanding into effective, reliable code. If I had more time, I would enhance the code documentation to make it more accessible for others who want to learn from it.

Throughout this class, I have gained several valuable skills that will benefit me in future coursework and projects. I have learned the importance of static code analysis, which has proven to be a simple yet thorough method for identifying code issues. Additionally, I now have experience using GPIO and UART to develop more sophisticated embedded systems.

To ensure my projects are robust, maintainable, and adaptable, I used state machines and created external diagrams to clearly define system behavior. This approach improved readability and made it easier to troubleshoot and extend the projects in the future.
